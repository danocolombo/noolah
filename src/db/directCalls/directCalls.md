# Direct Calls

This folder has files that can be run and tested with the drizzle database connection, without actually running the
NextJs app.

Example... drizzleIndex.ts -

-   inserts a new participant
-   lists all the participants
-   updates the new participant
-   deletes new participant

This file can be executed by running the ts file directly

bun tsx <filename>
